# Listening to Taylor Swift's *Red*

Album covers showcasing the artist's partially shaded face from the side. Album titles consisting of a single word of color. Women writing and singing with exuberant emotion and quite wisdom.

I think the notion of Taylor Swift being "the Joni Mitchell" of our generation is more ubiquitous than it is justified. Taylor's discography is sonically miles away from Joni's and is yet to stand the test of time. As an individual album, *Red*, while taking inspiration from numerous sources including *Blue*, is characterized by its riotous musical style and Taylor's swiftly maturing lyrical genius which make it unlike any other. However, I believe there is now consensus that *Red* is at least one of the defining singer-songwriter albums of our generation, and I feel lucky to have dived into Taylor's work around the time her audiences have started to reevaluate the album and reconsider its distinguishing strengths.

One of the main reasons that *Red* wasn't well received upon release was that it incorporated a wider range of musical genres than usual for a single album. It is undeniable that *Red* is less sonically cohesive than Taylor's other albums, notably *Fearless* and *1989* which are markedly straightforward when it comes to genre. In comparison, *Red* does perhaps offer a bit too much in one bite: the EDM and dubstep of *I Knew You Were Trouble*, the quirky teen pop vibe of *We are Never Ever Getting Back Together*, the rock elements in *State of Grace*, and the way country sounds melted so effortlessly into the AMA performance of *Red*. But what *Red* lacks in cohesiveness, it makes up for in sheer pleasure to the ear - the starkly different sounds of all these genres make for an exhilarating album, and not a single moment sounds monotonous or repetitive. Personally, I find that the juxtaposition of *I Knew You Were Trouble* and *All Too Well*, along with various similar track arrangements, create an irreplaceable listening experience. If any of Taylor's albums could justifiably take on a mash-up of musical styles, it would be *Red*. Taylor personally described the album as "a fractured mosaic of feelings". The wild, youthful emotions *Red* captures, "happy, free, confused and lonely" to mention a few, fill the track list up to the brim, demanding a plethora of sounds to paint each of them in the sharpest color.

These reckless swings in sound and emotion are present within single tracks just as much as in the album as a whole, creating some of the most celebrated tracks on *Red*. In *Treacherous*, compared with the calmness of the verses and the modesty of the chorus, the way the layering instrumentals drive the song to its climax at the bridge cuts through like a hot knife on butter, releasing the circumscribed energy under the opening melodies.

When it comes to lyrical skill, *Red* marks a new level of maturity in Taylor's career. Early on in her career as a songwriter, Taylor was most notably acclaimed for her elaborate descriptions of her honest and often vulnerable emotions. From the film-like verses of *Begin Again* to the plainly sweet chorus of *Everything has Changed*, this diary-like style of lyricism continues to be omnipresent in *Red*, showcasing even more detail and intimacy.

However, what I find to be more impressive is Taylor's growing ability to snapshot unique feelings in concise, meticulously chosen words. Let me start the analysis with an underrated line in the underrated "from the vault" song *I Bet You Think About Me*. The seven words "living room dancing and kitchen table bills" encapsulate the feeling of holding on to whatever fun is in reach in everyday life, which can often be mundane and cluttered with trifles. The carefully crafted line "and you know what they say you can't help who you fall for, and you and I fell like the early spring snow" is one of my favorite wordplays in Taylor's lyrics. The way Taylor can set up a vibe with a couple of simple-looking words is mind-blowing. "Mosaic broken hearts", "made of starlight", "holy ground", who else writes like this? The direct emotional appeal of "hey and you call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest", which is expressed so tersely it balances on the brink of offense, makes that line the single best lyric of the punchline-packed *All Too Well*. Now that's a mildly offensive statement, but I'll stand by it any time.

"In the land of heartbreak, moments of strength, independence, and devil-may-care rebellion are intricately woven together with grief, paralyzing vulnerability, and hopelessness." To shatter and burn, and to come back still delicate but still hopeful, is a state of mind that deserves an album dedicated to it. *State of Grace* is my single all-time favorite Taylor Swift song. It puts into words all the ruthlessness, bravery, and freedom in my wildest dreams, making it a representative of *Red* as a whole. I believe that we love *Red* from the bottom of our hearts precisely because it glorifies this vibrant mentality of grasping to love among the ashes, that gleams of the color red. Perhaps that is also why we love Taylor. She is and will always be a girl who loves and loses and yet loves again.

Writing this essay (review? comment?) wasn't easy, and I had to fumble out all my dormant linguistic ability and musical taste. It feels amazing to finally be able to put my love for *Red* down on paper. So that was my first post in the "music" category, dedicated to my personal favorite Taylor Swift album. I do hope I still have creative juices in me to write more  like this lol :>

**13 of my favorite lyrics in *Red*:**

> so you were never a saint, and I loved in shades of wrong, we learned to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts

> you call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest

> but you know what they say you can’t help who you fall for, and you and I fell like the early spring snow

> you were tossing me the car keys, “fuck the patriarchy”

> and you, hide away and find your peace of mind, with some indie record that’s much cooler than mine

> love is a ruthless game unless you play it good and right

> push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun

> up in your room and our slates are clean, just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

> and you’ve got your demons and darling they all look like me

> two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will get you, get you alone

> I was never good at telling jokes but the punchline goes, “I’ll get older but your lovers stay my age”

> in dreams I meet you in warm conversation, we both wake in lonely beds, different cities

> blocked the noise with the sound of “I need you”, and for the first time I had something to lose
