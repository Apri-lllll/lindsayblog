# About Me

Hola~ I am Lindsay, an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science. I am interested in deep learning, especially its applications in natural language processing.

My life goals include having two cats (named Pepper and Coconut), going to Coachella, and seeing *Hamilton* live at Broadway.

I irregularly write posts about random things that I find interesting ; )

# Random Thoughts

Steel wool cleaners are better at scrubbing out burnt woks than baking soda, white vinegar, or beer.

Please don't contact me. I wouldn't be able to reply, since I am a unicorn.
