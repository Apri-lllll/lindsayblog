# About Me

Hello~ I am Lindsay, an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science. I am interested in deep learning, especially its applications in educational data mining and natural language processing.

My life goals include having two cats (named Pepper and Coconut), going to Coachella, and being able to memorize all the words in *Hamilton*.

I irregularly write blogs on random things that I find interesting. Hope you enjoy reading them~
