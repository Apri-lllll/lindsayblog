# About Me

Hi~ I am Lindsay, an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science. I am interested in deep learning, especially its applications in natural language processing.

My life goals include having two cats (named Pepper and Coconut), going to Coachella, and seeing *Hamilton* live at Broadway.

I irregularly write posts about random things that I find interesting ; )
