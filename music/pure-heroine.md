# Listening to Lorde's *Pure Heroine*

This statement is purely personal, but I will say it anyway: *Melodrama* is the better album, but *Pure Heroine* is and will always be *the* Lorde album for me.

One thing I learned from listening to Lorde's music is that narratives do not have to be grand to be brilliant. Personal but universal, *Pure Heroine* carves out a modern teenage stereotype: feigning indifference, scoffing at glamor, cherishing and fearing loneliness just the same - one that we are more than willing to be identified as. The throbbing teenage impulses cascading from her music make me fear that someday I might not be able to relate to her the same way I do now. In some ways, *Pure Heroine* perfectly marks the feeling of being fleetingly young, seemingly carefree, occasionally miserable.

The much-cherished minimalist production of *Pure Heroine* makes the sonic facet of the album equally intriguing. In a way, the stripped-down synths and the cut-to-the-bone honesty of the lyrics share a similar mentality, seamlessly complementing each other to accomplish the coherent flow of the album. What's more curious is how the nuances among the similarly styled production snippets allow each of them to find a perfect niche within a song - sometimes embracing repetition to put the spotlight on the song's lyrical content, as in the pre-chorus of *Royals*; other times coming to the foreground to build up a vibe in a way words cannot, as in the opening of *Ribs*.

And to think that Lorde wrote these songs at seventeen... The day I turned eighteen this summer, I basically had two thoughts about this coming-of-age business. One is that lawfully becoming an adult is great. Another is the reluctance to never again be the same age as "the Lorde who wrote *Pure Heroine*".

So indeed, I can call her queen bee.



#### Some of my favorite lyrics

> I'm only as young as the minute is, full of it, getting pumped up from the little bright things I bought, But I know they'll never own me

> It's a new art form showing people how little we care

> I've never seen a diamond in the flesh, I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies

> This dream isn't feeling sweet, we're reeling through the midnight streets
> And I've never felt more alone, it feels so scary, getting old

> And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive, 'cause what this palace wants is release

> Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay
> It's buzzcut season anyway

> Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream

> But in all chaos, there is calculation
> Dropping glasses just to hear them break

> We're a train wreck waiting to happen

> That slow burn wait while it gets dark, bruising the sun
> I feel grown up with you in your car, I know it's dumb
