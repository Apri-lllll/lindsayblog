# About Me

Hello~ I am Lindsay Qu, an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science. I am interested in deep learning and its applications.

My life goals include having two cats (named Pepper and Coconut), going to Coachella, and being able to memorize all the words in *Hamilton*.

I irregularly write blogs on random things that I find interesting. Hope you enjoy reading them~
