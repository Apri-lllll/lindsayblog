# Reading *The Great Gatsby*

Both the beginning and the ending sentences of *The Great Gatsby* are so widely celebrated that I can't recall whether I was first introduced to the former as a lesson on morality or the latter as an example of alliteration. It's interesting how these opening and closing sentences correspond to two prominent themes in *The Great Gatsby* - moral judgments and life ambitions.

*The Great Gatsby* describes ambition from two perspectives: Gatsby's personal obsession with Daisy, and the general society's endless pursuit of wealth and opulence. These two types of ambition share similar strokes of tragic wistfulness. They are more often than not unachievable, but the more striking tragic facet of such aspirations may be the way they are rooted in fragile fantasies rather than the plain truth.









A lesser discussed but equally important theme of *The Great Gatsby* is morality and its implications, mostly illustrated through the detailed narrations of Nick. 









I don't normally enjoy reading books whose paragraphs are lavishly embellished with literary devices and lengthy descriptions like lights on a Christmas tree. However, Fitzgerald embellished the words in *The Great Gatsby* in an irresistible way, which made me linger on a sentence every once in a while and also drew me to read the book a second time.
